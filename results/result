# Results and Visualizations

This folder contains the output, visualizations, and evaluation metrics from the analysis performed in the project.

## Suggested Structure

- `detections/` — Images with YOLOv3 detections (parking, housing, etc.)
- `metrics/` — Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)
- `plots/` — Charts and visualizations (distribution graphs, confusion matrices, etc.)
- `reports/` — Summary reports and findings

## How to Add Results

1. Save any images or plots from your analysis in the appropriate subfolder.
2. Document key findings in Markdown or PDF format within the `reports/` folder.
3. Update this README with links to important results as your analysis progresses.

## Example

- [detections/sample_detection.png](detections/sample_detection.png)
- [metrics/evaluation_metrics.csv](metrics/evaluation_metrics.csv)
- [plots/area_distribution.png](plots/area_distribution.png)
- [reports/summary.md](reports/summary.md)
